# diffONT_paper
diffONT is a python-based tool for predicting methylation-specific PCR (MSP) primers, based on Nanopore sequencing data. Given multiple bedmethyl files, diffONT detects methylation specific PCR primer regions, which can distinguish between two groups of samples (originally cancer patients vs. healthy controls).
